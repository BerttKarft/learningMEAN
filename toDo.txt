To do list comprises of daily objectives that I want to accomplish. Will be determined on how much time is available.
This list will go by months and just like the README this document will be archived in a seperate folder in the repository.


!!!All toDo's will be put into this toDo.txt!!!!!



Wizard:
A = Actively doing project at time of push to repository.
E = Excused (Emergencies or higher priority agenda excuse a goal)
x = Complete
R = Under Revision (Doing an activity I should have done previously)


For the blog, I am planning on implementing it either server wide or using a hosting application to get the blog online. It'll have to wait for my financial situation to better.
